1.1 Write a program to store random numbers into an array of n integers and then find out
the smallest and largest number stored in it. n is the user input.

1.2 Write a program to store random numbers into an array of n integers, where the array
must cotains some duplicates. Do the following:
a) Find out the total number of duplicate elements.
b) Find out the most repeating element in the array.

1.3 Write a program to rearrange the elements of an array of n integers such that all even
numbers are followed by all odd numbers. How many different ways you can solve this
problem. Write your approaches & strategy for solving this problem.

1.4 Write a program that takes three variable (a, b, c) as separate parameters and rotates the
values stored so that value a goes to be, b, b to c and c to a by using SWAP(x,y)
function that swaps/exchanges the numbers x & y.

1.5 Let A be n*n square matrix array. WAP by using appropriate user defined functions for
the following:
a) Find the number of nonzero elements in A
b) Find the sum of the elements above the leading diagonal.
c) Display the elements below the minor diagonal.
d) Find the product of the diagonal elements.

1.6 Write a program to find out the second smallest and second largest element stored in an
array of n integers. n is the user input. The array takes input through random number
generation within a given range. How many different ways you can solve this problem.
Write your approaches & strategy for solving this problem.

1.7 Write a program to swap pair of elements of an array of n integers from starting. If n is
odd, then last number will be remain unchanged.

1.8 Write a program to display an array of n integers (n>1), where at every index of the
array should contain the product of all elements in the array except the element at the
given index. Solve this problem by taking single loop and without an additional array.
